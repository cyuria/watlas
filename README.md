# The Atlas

The atlas is at heart a launcher program, like all the others. Where the atlas
shines is that it does much more than most launchers. The atlas is more of a
map (or atlas) of your system. It provides system status info (like you would
get with any status bar), application launching capabilities, custom
configurable "buttons" and even arbitrary shell command execution.

## Naming

Feel free to interchangably use any terms you wish to refer to the atlas/
watlas. Language evolves and the only thing that matters is that people know
what you are referring to.

The 'W' in watlas actually does have meaning, but deciphering that meaning is
left as an exercise to the reader.
